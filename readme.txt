Over the course of several months, I have developed a menu that allows you to add lightbars on any vehicle you want.
 The basic premise is that you drive a vehicle to designated areas, (Defaultly garages as all police departments) 
 hit F6. You will be met with a menu and are able to select which type of lightbar you wish to spawn. 
 Then, use your Arrow Keys and other keys indicated by the hint to move and rotate the lightbar. 
 When you have placed it where you want it to be attached, simply hit SPACE and it will be attached. 
 You may add multiple lightbars to the same vehicle and they are usable by all players. 
 I have previously been holding off on releasing this script, as I intended this to be used privately, however, 
 have recently changed my mind.

**Key Bindings:**

Open Menu: F6
Move Forward: Up Arrow Key
Move Backward: Down Arrow Key
Move Left: Left Arrow Key
Move Right: Right Arrow Key
Move Up: Page Up
Move Down: Page Down
Flip: INS and DEL (Above arrow keys)
Cancel Lightbar Placement: Backspace
Confirm Placement: Space bar
Activate Lights: Q 
Activate Horn: E
Activate Sirens: G
Cycle Siren Tones: Left Control



**Installation:**

Simply Drag into your resources folder and add both resources to your startup list in the server config
*Note* In order for the menu and all aspects of the script to work, you must utilize all resources given in the download


**Additional Notes:** 
Currently, the menu is accessible by all players, meaning that anyone can use it. In order to defeat this, **you must** replace the commented out if statement on line 433 with whatever your server uses.
Furthermore, this script has not been tested on a large scale and consequently may have minor glitches. Please report these so they can be fixed. If you have any questions as to how to do something, feel free to ask.
Finally, I have invested many months into making this work and brainstorming ideas. Please do not pass this off as your own.
